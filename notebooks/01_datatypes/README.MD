# 01_datatypes – Python Data Types

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that explain and demonstrate all the fundamental data types in Python, including both built-in and lesser-known types. It is designed to help beginners understand what each data type is, when and why to use it, and its strengths and limitations.

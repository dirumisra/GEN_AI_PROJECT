    "# ---- Explanation of Concepts ----\n",
    "# 1. `nonlocal`: Used to refer to a variable in the enclosing (but non-global) scope.\n",
    "#    - Example: When we use nonlocal num in the inner function, we are modifying num from the outer function.\n",
    "#    - When to use: Use `nonlocal` when you need to modify a variable in the enclosing scope (usually a parent function).\n",
    "#    - Pros: \n",
    "#       - Useful in closures or nested functions where inner functions need to modify variables from the outer function.\n",
    "#       - Avoids the creation of a new local variable in the inner function.\n",
    "#    - Cons:\n",
    "#       - Can make code harder to read if many nested functions are involved.\n",
    "#       - Can be confusing when you have several nested functions modifying the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. `global`: Used to refer to a variable in the global scope.\n",
    "#    - Example: When we use global count, we are modifying the global variable count.\n",
    "#    - When to use: Use `global` when you need to modify a variable defined in the global scope (outside any function).\n",
    "#    - Pros:\n",
    "#       - Easy to share state between multiple functions.\n",
    "#       - Simple to implement when you need a global state, like a counter or a configuration value.\n",
    "#    - Cons:\n",
    "#       - Makes code harder to maintain and debug as the state is shared across multiple functions.\n",
    "#       - May lead to unintended side effects since global variables can be modified from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---- Additional Examples ----\n",
    "# Example of using `nonlocal` to modify a variable in the enclosing scope:\n",
    "def outer():\n",
    "    num = 5  # Variable in the enclosing scope\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def inner():\n",
    "        nonlocal num  # Refers to 'num' from the outer function\n",
    "        num += 2  # Modify 'num' from the outer function\n",
    "        return num  # Returns the modified value of 'num'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return inner()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(outer())  # Output: 7 (num is modified by inner function)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of using `global` to modify a global variable:\n",
    "counter = 0  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global counter  # Modify the global counter\n",
    "    counter += 1  # Increment the global counter by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "increment()  # Increment counter\n",
    "print(counter)  # Output: 1 (global counter has been incremented)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---- Conclusion ----\n",
    "# - `nonlocal` is best used when you need to modify a variable from an enclosing scope (e.g., in nested functions or closures).\n",
    "# - `global` is useful when you need to modify a global variable, but it should be used cautiously to avoid unexpected behavior and side effects.\n",
    "# - Both keywords can lead to more complex code, so use them judiciously and understand their impact on your program's state.\n",
